        Cristiano Ronaldo's football journey, marked by unwavering work ethic
        and versatility, began at Sporting Lisbon, showcasing prowess in
        positions like winger, striker, and midfielder. Sir Alex Ferguson's
        recognition at Manchester United led to Ronaldo donning the iconic
        number 7 jersey, orchestrating plays in the midfield and securing a
        historic 2008 Ballon d'Or while propelling the team to Premier League
        glory. A move to Real Madrid transformed him into a goal-scoring
        machine, contributing to four UEFA Champions League titles. As captain,
        Ronaldo's leadership saw an astonishing unbeaten record when he hold the
        captain arm band in 438 games, solidifying his status as one of the
        greatest footballers. Affectionately called "MRS UCL," he holds
        unparalleled records in the Champions League, conquering it with both
        Manchester United and Real Madrid. At 39, Ronaldo continues to defy
        expectations with 875 career goals, leaving an indelible mark on the
        beautiful game.

      <p> leo Messi is a great player that have many skills, but needs a powerful team.
        During Lionel Messi's illustrious career at FC Barcelona, there were specific records and milestones that he did not achieve.
         One notable example is the elusive UEFA Champions League triumph in his later years with the club.
          Despite numerous domestic successes, Barcelona faced challenges in reclaiming the European 
          title during Messi's final seasons. Additionally, he fell short of securing an Olympic gold medal with the Argentine national team 
          during his tenure at Barcelona. On an individual level, Messi didn't surpass Pel√©'s record 
          of scoring over 643 goals for a single club, as his departure from Barcelona
           occurred just shy of breaking this historic milestone. While Messi's time at Barcelona was marked 
           by brilliance, certain specific achievements remained beyond his grasp, adding a layer of complexity to his otherwise
            stellar legacy at the club. and he lose about 79% of the games while he have been the captain </p>
